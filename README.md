# Minimalistic Blog Platform with Temporary Feedback Mechanism

# Introduction
This project is a modern, minimalistic blog platform built with Next.js, designed to deliver a clean and focused reading experience. In addition to beautifully displayed blogs, the platform features a temporary feedback mechanism that allows users to submit reviews.
