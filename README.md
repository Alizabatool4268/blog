# Minimalistic Blog Platform with Temporary Feedback Mechanism

## Introduction
This project is a modern, minimalistic blog platform built with Next.js, designed to deliver a clean and focused reading experience. In addition to beautifully displayed blogs, the platform features a temporary feedback mechanism that allows users to submit reviews. These reviews appear instantly on the screen but are not stored permanently, creating a fresh start with each session and maintaining the platformâ€™s lightweight, clutter-free nature.
